# Lbfgsb.jl


This is wrapper of the famous [lbfgsb fortran library] of Julia language inspired by [this wrapper] further adapted to julia 0.6 by Jean-Pierre Dussault.

## version
0.0.1 (just usable)

## Platform
Currently only for Linux with ```gfortran``` installed


## Copyright Notice
  File fotran routine is written by the authors of the following papers,

## Warning
I am new to Julia language so the code will be cleaned gradually

## usage
  - First, run ```Pkg.clone("https://github.com/vepiteski/Lbfgsb.jl")```, then run ```Pkg.build("Lbfgsb")```
  - Currently only provide a function called ```lbfgsb```, see its option below,

  JPD has added interfaces to NLPModels and Stopping.

# Options
  - ```ogFunc``` :  Objective and gradient function. It accept current ```x``` and a gradient array ```g```. It should return the objective function value and put the gradient into into ```g```.
  - ```x``` : Initial value of ```x```.
  - ```lb``` : lower bounds of each dimension of ```x```. Set to ```-Inf``` if equals to ```[]```.
  - ```ub``` : upper bounds of each dimension of ```x```. Set to ```Inf``` if equals to ```[]```.
  - ```btype``` : boundary types, see below,


| btype | boundary type of corresponding dimension |
| :---: |:----------------------------------------:|
|     0 | unbounded                                |
|     1 | only lower bound                         |
|     2 | both lower and upper bound               |
|     3 | only upper bound                         |


  - Other parameters : see the paper above for reference (mostly does not need to modify)
  - ```iprint``` : printing level of the fortran routine, set to ```-1``` if you does not want to print anything
